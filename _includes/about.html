          Hello! I'm <strong>Erica Sousa</strong>, passionate about technology, data and artificial intelligence. 
          I started my academic journey in <strong>2023</strong>, pursuing a degree in 
          <strong>Analysis and Systems Development (PUCPR)</strong>, with graduation planned for <strong>2025</strong>. 
          Since then, I have been dedicating myself to building a strong foundation in programming, software engineering, and data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I have developed and contributed to projects involving 
          <strong>machine learning, computer vision, image segmentation, classification, and data pipelines</strong>. 
          I also worked with <em>data preprocessing, model training, metrics evaluation, and visualization</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical skills include <strong>Python, Java, SQL, Docker</strong> and frameworks like 
          <strong>TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, FastAPI, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR</strong>. 
          I also use tools such as <strong>Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, and Excel</strong> to support my workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim to combine my academic background with practical experience to become a professional capable of 
          designing intelligent solutions that add value to people and organizations. 
          I'm constantly learning and seeking to apply knowledge in real-world projects.
