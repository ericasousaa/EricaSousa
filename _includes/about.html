          Hello! I'm <strong>Erica Sousa</strong>, passionate about technology, data and artificial intelligence. 
          I started my academic journey in <strong>2023</strong>, pursuing a degree in 
          <strong>Analysis and Systems Development (PUCPR)</strong>, with graduation planned for <strong>2025</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have been dedicating myself to building a strong foundation in <strong>programming, machine learning, data science, and computer vision</strong>. 
          I have worked on projects involving <em>image segmentation, classification, regression, and data analysis</em>, always focusing on practical applications and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical skills include <strong>Python, Java, SQL, Docker</strong> and frameworks like 
          <strong>TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, FastAPI, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR</strong>. 
          I also rely on tools such as <strong>Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, and Excel</strong> to support my workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to continue improving my expertise in AI and data-driven solutions, applying knowledge through real-world projects and 
          becoming a professional capable of delivering <strong>intelligent, scalable, and impactful solutions</strong>.
